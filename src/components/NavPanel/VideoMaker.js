                      College coaches generally donâ€™t have the time or budget it takes to see
                      hundreds of volleyball recruits in person each year. Video can be a helpful
                      first step in getting a college coach's attention or following up with one
                      after an event. A well-done video and effective distribution strategy is an
                      essential steps in the recruiting process.
